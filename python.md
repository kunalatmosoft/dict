Sure, I will provide detailed explanations for each topic in the diagram along with the code snippets already provided.

### 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. It encompasses a wide range of techniques and applications.

### 2. Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning is a subset of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.

#### 2.1. Linear / Logistic Regression
- **Linear Regression**: Used to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. The goal is to fit a linear relationship between the variables.
  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  import numpy as np

  X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
  y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3

  model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
  print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
  print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
  print("Predictions:", model.predict(np.array([[3, 5]])))
  ```

- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification tasks where the outcome variable is categorical. It models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.
  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

  X = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]])
  y = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])

  model = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)
  print("Coefficients:", model.coef_)
  print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
  print("Predictions:", model.predict(np.array([[1, 2]])))
  ```

#### 2.2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
SVMs are supervised learning models that can be used for classification or regression. They work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes.
  ```python
  from sklearn import svm

  X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
  y = [0, 1]

  model = svm.SVC()
  model.fit(X, y)
  print("Predictions:", model.predict([[2, 2]]))
  ```

#### 2.3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm where an instance is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors.
  ```python
  from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

  X = [[0], [1], [2], [3]]
  y = [0, 0, 1, 1]

  model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
  model.fit(X, y)
  print("Predictions:", model.predict([[1.5]]))
  ```

#### 2.4. Decision Trees
Decision trees are flowchart-like structures where an internal node represents a feature (or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.
  ```python
  from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

  X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
  y = [0, 1]

  model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
  model.fit(X, y)
  print("Predictions:", model.predict([[2, 2]]))
  ```

#### 2.5. Random Forest
Random forests are ensemble learning methods for classification and regression that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes or mean prediction.
  ```python
  from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

  X = [[0, 0], [1, 1]]
  y = [0, 1]

  model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)
  model.fit(X, y)
  print("Predictions:", model.predict([[2, 2]]))
  ```

#### 2.6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a dimensionality-reduction method used to reduce the number of variables of a dataset while preserving as much information as possible.
  ```python
  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

  X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8]])

  pca = PCA(n_components=2)
  principalComponents = pca.fit_transform(X)
  print("Principal Components:", principalComponents)
  ```

### 3. Neural Networks (NN)
Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that work together to recognize patterns.

#### 3.1. Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
MLPs are a class of feedforward artificial neural network consisting of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.
  ```python
  from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier

  X = [[0., 0.], [1., 1.]]
  y = [0, 1]

  model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(5, 2), max_iter=1000)
  model.fit(X, y)
  print("Predictions:", model.predict([[2., 2.], [-1., -2.]]))
  ```

#### 3.2. Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN)
RBFNs use radial basis functions as activation functions. They are particularly useful for interpolation in multi-dimensional space.
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  from sklearn.kernel_ridge import KernelRidge

  X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
  y = np.sin(X).ravel()

  model = KernelRidge(alpha=1.0, kernel='rbf')
  model.fit(X, y)
  print("Predictions:", model.predict(np.array([[5]])))
  ```

#### 3.3. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)
SOMs are used for clustering and visualization. They reduce dimensions by producing a map of usually one or two dimensions which plot the similarities of the data.
  ```python
  from minisom import MiniSom

  X = np.random.rand(100, 3)

  som = MiniSom(7, 7, 3, sigma=0.3, learning_rate=0.5)
  som.train_random(X, 100)  # Training

  print("Winning node for first sample:", som.winner(X[0]))
  ```

#### 3.4. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
RNNs are a class of neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence, which allows them to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.
  ```python
  from keras.models import Sequential
  from keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense

  timesteps = 10
  features = 1
  model = Sequential()
  model.add(SimpleRNN(100, input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
  model.add(Dense(1))
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
  ```

#### 3.5. Hopfield Networks
Hopfield networks are a type of recurrent neural network that serves as content-addressable memory systems with binary threshold nodes.
  ```python
  import numpy as np

  class HopfieldNetwork:
      def __init__(self, n_units):
          self.n_units = n_units
          self.weights = np.zeros((n_units, n_units))

      def train(self, patterns):
          for p in patterns:
              self.weights += np.outer(p, p)
          np.fill_diagonal(self.weights, 0)

      def predict(self, pattern, steps=5):
          for _ in range(steps):
              pattern = np.sign(self.weights @ pattern)
          return pattern

  patterns = np.array([[1, -1, 1], [-1, 1, -1]])
  hn = HopfieldNetwork(3)
  hn.train(patterns)
  print("Prediction:", hn.predict(np.array([1, 1, -1])))
  ```

### 4. Deep Learning (DL)
Deep Learning is a subset of ML focused on neural networks with many layers.

#### 4.1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
CNNs are primarily used for image recognition tasks. They use convolutional layers that apply a convolution operation to the input, passing the result to the next layer.
  ```python
  from keras.models import Sequential
  from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

  model = Sequential()
  model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)))
  model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
  model.add(Flatten())
  model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
  model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  ```

#### 4.2. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)
LSTMs are a type of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies. They are well-suited to classifying, processing, and predicting time series data.
  ```python
  from keras.models import Sequential
  from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

  model = Sequential()
  model.add(LSTM(100, input_shape=(timesteps, features)))
  model.add(Dense(1))
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
  ```

#### 4.3.

 Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates fake data, and the discriminator evaluates it against real data.
  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Reshape, Flatten, BatchNormalization
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential

  def build_generator():
      model = Sequential()
      model.add(Dense(256, input_dim=100))
      model.add(BatchNormalization())
      model.add(Dense(512))
      model.add(BatchNormalization())
      model.add(Dense(1024))
      model.add(BatchNormalization())
      model.add(Dense(28 * 28 * 1, activation='tanh'))
      model.add(Reshape((28, 28, 1)))
      return model

  def build_discriminator():
      model = Sequential()
      model.add(Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
      model.add(Dense(512))
      model.add(Dense(256))
      model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
      return model

  generator = build_generator()
  discriminator = build_discriminator()
  discriminator.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

  z = tf.keras.Input(shape=(100,))
  img = generator(z)
  discriminator.trainable = False
  valid = discriminator(img)
  combined = tf.keras.Model(z, valid)
  combined.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
  ```

#### 4.4. Transformer Models (e.g., BERT, GPT)
Transformer models are a type of deep learning model primarily used for natural language processing tasks. They use a mechanism called attention to capture the context of a word in a sentence.
  ```python
  from transformers import pipeline

  nlp_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
  result = nlp_pipeline("I love using transformers for NLP tasks!")
  print(result)
  ```

#### 4.5. Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
DBNs are a type of deep neural network composed of multiple layers of stochastic, latent variables. They are generative models that learn to reconstruct their inputs.
